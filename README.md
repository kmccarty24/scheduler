# Northumbria Sleep Study Scheduler

This will be the Northumbria Sleep Scheduler, written in Python3 and using PsychoPy as its GUI for the moment, but will eventuially migrate to something like tkinter. iOS app might follow for the iPad.

# Notes for Kris 
Time is brought in as simple HH:MM and the date aspect is brought in on runtime.
